Vet Recommendations: In many areas of the world, the rabies vaccine for dogs is a legal requirement. But legal necessity isn't the only reason why this vaccine is vital. Survival from rabies is extremely rare for both dogs and humans alike. This puts the rabies vaccine for dogs at the very top of the list for must-have, core canine vaccines. Note: Being one of the most dangerous diseases to mammals, certain actions need to be taken if rabies is suspected in dogs, such as the following: • If someone is bitten or scratched by a suspected rabid dog (or another rabid animal), promptly reach out to your healthcare provider and local public health department. • A suspected rabid dog must undergo quarantine measures to safeguard the household and community. This also enables close observation of the potentially rabid dog, aiding in assessing the need for rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for individuals exposed to the dog. • Rabid animals might exhibit aggressive behavior. If assistance is required, please contact your local animal control authorities..",

Though more common in puppies, parvovirus can infect older dogs too. This disease is not transmissible to human beings. However, wild animals like raccoons, coyotes, and minks can also be infected with it. Therefore, there is some risk involving these animals leaving droppings in your yard or on a hiking trail where your puppy or dog may go. Symptoms: The symptoms of canine parvovirus include depression, lethargy, lack or complete loss of appetite, sudden fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. Though CPV is not always fatal, in some cases, it can produce dehydration or shock that leads to death. Vet Recommendations: The parvovirus vaccine, which is a part of a combination shot called the DHPP vaccine for dogs, is a vital core canine vaccine. Given that a parvovirus infection can lead to life-threatening symptoms, getting this vaccine is highly recommended for all dogs..",

Core vaccines are those that all dogs, regardless of circumstances or location, should receive. They protect the animals from severe, life-threatening disease. The three core vaccines for dogs in North America are those against canine distemper virus (CDV), canine adenovirus 2 (CAV-2), and canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2). Additional vaccines may also be considered to be essential by the attending veterinarian based on their professional judgment. One obvious such example is rabies vaccine, especially in countries where rabies is endemic. Rabies vaccination is also legally required in many jurisdictions and is mandatory for international travel. Noncore vaccines are those whose use is also based upon careful risk assessment by a veterinarian in consultation with the dog owner. These risks will vary with the type of vaccine used, geographic location, local environment, degree of exposure to other dogs, and the dog’s lifestyle.",
